To run this program, you must have python3 installed on your computer. To download it, go to [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Next, you must download [pyautogui](https://pypi.org/project/PyAutoGUI/), [urllib3](https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#installing-beautiful-soup).

After that, download the source code, navigate to the file in your terminal / command prompt, and type "python3 main.py" then click on the application you want to send the messages in (in my case iMessage), and the let the program do its work. If you want to stop the program from running, type Ctrl+C into the terminal / Command Prompt or quickly navigate your mouse to the top left of the screen to activate the failsafe.

Enjoy!
